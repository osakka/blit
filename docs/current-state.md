# Current state and restart point

This is the handoff document for resuming Blit work after a session change. It
is intentionally evidence-led and does not replace the OpenAPI contract,
source, ADRs, or the verification ledger. It tells the next engineer where the
work actually stopped.

## Status at the last review

Blit `0.1.509` is deployed on the authorized host at `192.168.10.54` and
reports API version `0.1`. The matching package identity is recorded in
[`releases/0.1.509.yaml`](../releases/0.1.509.yaml). Hibr source was not
modified.

The source branch now contains and has pushed the rendering/protocol fixes from
issues #84, #85, #87, and #88 at commit `739800f`. Those fixes are validated by
the SDL graphics-band gate, the sixel-slot gate, the direct-KMS compositor gate,
and the completed terminal-conformance cases, but they are not yet deployed to
the host and are therefore not host-accepted.

### Architecture decision check

There is no accepted decision to deprecate the direct DRM/KMS or non-SDL
backend. ADR 0004 remains accepted and defines direct DRM/KMS as the
correctness-critical terminal presentation path; SDL3 is the adapter for the
optional canvas/effects path. The OpenAPI contract, source, package, tests, and
verification ledger all still describe both paths. Do not remove KMS code or
rewrite those references unless a new, explicitly accepted ADR supersedes ADR
0004. “SDL3/KMSDRM” and “direct DRM/KMS” are distinct paths and must not be
collapsed into one undocumented implementation.

The `0.1.509` package carries the authenticated
`GET /v1/diagnostics/observation` endpoint. It is a schema-first aggregate of
the existing serializers for one operational state dump. The endpoint is
installed and live-verified on `192.168.10.54`.

The exact live presentation-path mapping was revalidated on 2026-10-16:

- SDL/OpenGL means `backend=sdl3`, `video_driver=kmsdrm`,
  `renderer=opengles2`, and `presentation_sync=sdl-vsync`;
- SDL/software means `backend=sdl3`, `video_driver=kmsdrm`,
  `renderer=software`, and `presentation_sync=scheduler-only`;
- direct KMS means `backend=drm-kms`, `direct_kms=true`,
  `video_driver=direct-kms`, no SDL renderer, and
  `presentation_sync=drm-page-flip`.

All three live paths reached `ready=true` on the single 1920x2160@60 Hz
output with empty diagnostic errors and warnings. This validates path
selection and readiness only; it is not visual acceptance of the Hibr desktop.
The host was then restored to SDL/KMSDRM + OpenGLES2, with the login manager
running and ready for the next physical observation.

The product is **not visually accepted**. The latest authenticated screenshot
capture showed a coherent flat-colour scene with the menu/status line but no
Kitty graphics in either live session. Earlier captures also showed a stale
surface containing `[desktop ended, status 0]` and a failed join containing
`hibr: hold: no such session`. These are live failures, not acceptable desktop
output.

The following narrower claims are supported:

- the server answers `/v1/version` and `/v1/diagnostics/runtime` over TCP;
- a fresh primary plus one `--join` can be created through the API when the
  primary establishes the Hibr hold first;
- API-injected pointer stress reached 600 input events and 531 presentations
  with zero new missed deadlines in that interval;
- the deterministic pointer-damage, motion-trail, wallpaper-stress, and Hibr
  frame-barrier gates pass locally;
- physical acceptance is **not measured**: the latest 20-second capture saw no
  physical evdev motion or button event, so it cannot diagnose real window
  dragging.

These results do not prove that the wallpaper, desktop scene, context menus,
window movement, physical mouse, keyboard, or joined coordinate system works.
An unchanged or incomplete screenshot is a failed visual result even when
timing counters are healthy.

### Latest live read-only boundary

On 2026-10-16, the post-deployment observation query to `192.168.10.54`
reported `0.1.509`, SDL3/OpenGLES2, one `DP-1` output at 1920x2160@60 Hz,
one running login-manager session, and two keyboards/two pointers discovered.
The observation endpoint returned `observation_version: 1`, the
`single_event_loop_turn` marker, 158 presentation calls, zero missed deadlines
at capture, and one graphics payload. It does not change the visual acceptance
status: the running session is still the login manager rather than a Hibr
desktop, so #86 and the complete desktop/join capture remain open.

## Non-negotiable claim rule

Do not use “stable”, “working”, “correct”, “complete”, or “fixed” without a
scope and matching evidence. In particular:

1. timing stability means only measured scheduling/presentation behaviour;
2. process stability means only lifecycle state and exit/restart behaviour;
3. visual correctness requires a screenshot or pixel assertion showing the
   expected complete scene;
4. physical input requires evdev traces from the device under test;
5. Hibr interaction requires evidence that Hibr received the event and changed
   its surface, not merely that Blit accepted or forwarded an event;
6. joined-desktop acceptance requires both pane screenshots, graphics state,
   coordinate traces, and a visible window/context-menu interaction;
7. if any required visual or interaction evidence is missing or contradictory,
   the overall result remains incomplete.

Never promote a synthetic API result, QEMU result, or partial screenshot to
physical-host acceptance. Record the exact evidence, limitation, and next
boundary instead.

## Correct live orchestration

The live host currently uses one physical output split into two panes: the
primary is the lower pane and the join is the upper pane. The safe sequence is:

1. query `/v1/version`, `/v1/diagnostics/runtime`, `/v1/topology`, and
   `/v1/terminal-sessions`;
2. remove only exited/stale Blit terminal-session resources;
3. start exactly one primary with the installed Blit Hibr entrypoint and the
   Hibr held-session name;
4. wait until the primary surface contains a real desktop/menu and has a
   nontrivial surface revision;
5. start one `--join` client against the same Hibr held-session name in the
   upper pane;
6. verify both sessions are `running`, both surfaces are distinct, and neither
   contains an exit/error line;
7. capture the screenshot and graphics/session snapshots before testing input;
8. perform physical input capture while a visible window is available.

Do not start a join against a dead or merely stale Blit primary. The observed
failure mode is a join with `hibr: hold: no such session`, followed by retained
old pixels if the exited surface is not removed. Do not interpret those pixels
as a current desktop.

The primary invocation is a normal create request using the installed
entrypoint, for example:

```sh
curl --fail --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"command":"/usr/share/blit/hibr/blit-session.hibr","arguments":["--session","desktop","--name","display-1"],"user":"osakka","display_id":"display-1","pane_id":"pane-display-1-2","surface_mode":"terminal"}' \
  http://192.168.10.54:8080/v1/terminal-sessions
```

The join uses the same command and session name with `--join` and the upper
pane. The exact pane IDs must always come from `/v1/topology`; never invent or
hard-code them in a client.

## Next investigation, in order

The next cycle is a rendering/interaction investigation, not a performance
claim cycle:

1. reproduce the complete expected Hibr scene in one primary pane and capture
   its terminal cells, graphics inventory, filtered traces, and screenshot;
2. determine whether Hibr emitted the expected Kitty payload at all; if it did
   not, stop at the Hibr boundary and do not blame SDL composition;
3. if the payload is present, compare graphics placement/source rectangles and
   scene signatures with the screenshot, first with one pane and then with the
   join;
4. only after a complete static scene is visible, run a physical capture with
   a visible window and correlate evdev motion/button -> Hibr surface revision
   -> render path -> presentation;
5. use the first missing boundary as the defect location and make one surgical
   change;
6. rebuild with TCC, run the focused renderer/Hibr gates, deploy the exact
   package, repeat the same capture, update the ledger, commit, and push.

Do not change Hibr source. If the evidence identifies a Hibr hold, viewport,
picture-propagation, or desktop-semantic defect, record or update the Hibr
issue and keep the Blit diagnosis separate.

## Open-backlog order

The open issues are worked in evidence order, not issue-number order:

1. **#86 — live Kitty wallpaper discriminator.** Capture Hibr's graphics
   decision and Blit's per-session graphics trace on the deployed binary. The
   first missing boundary determines whether the next change belongs in Blit
   or needs a separate Hibr issue.
2. **#84, #85, #87, #88 — renderer/protocol fixes.** These are implemented and
   pushed, but require package deployment and host acceptance before they can
   be closed.
3. **#76, #77, #78 — `console-blit` input/provider boundary.** Exercise only
   after a complete static scene is visible, so input evidence is not confused
   with a missing wallpaper or stale surface.
4. **#79, #20, #21 — hardware/renderer coverage gates.** These need GPU,
   multiple physical outputs, or high-refresh hardware and cannot be closed by
   a local SDL software run.
5. **#22, #27, #60, #64, #82, #83.** These are coverage, workflow, resize,
   persistent configuration, image-build, and login-manager work to schedule
   after the live rendering boundary is established.

This order is a triage record, not a second backlog. Gitea issues remain the
authoritative task records; this document records only the dependency order
and the evidence required to move between them.

## Evidence locations

Temporary captures are outside Git. The latest relevant local captures were:

- `/tmp/blit-clean-state-20261016/` — fresh primary+join screenshot; visually
  incomplete flat-colour scene;
- `/tmp/blit-physical-drag-20261016-174655/` — authenticated 20-second
  physical capture with no evdev motion observed;
- `/tmp/blit-physical-move-20261016-172710/` — earlier no-input capture whose
  screenshot contained the stale ended primary/join failure.

These paths are evidence for the current workspace only. Do not commit them,
their credentials, or generated packages. The durable summary belongs in
[`docs/verification-status.md`](verification-status.md).
