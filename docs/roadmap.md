# blit roadmap

The roadmap is ordered by dependency. A later milestone must not become a
second, parallel implementation of an earlier one.

## Current position

The platform capability gate is passing in the deterministic VKMS fixture:

- TCC `0.9.27` compiles and links the SDL3 probe.
- SDL3 initializes through KMSDRM without X11 or Wayland.
- One DRM card exposes two virtual outputs.
- A fullscreen SDL window is created successfully across that fixture.

The initial product slice is now running: the OpenAPI contract, loopback TCP
gateway, PTY sessions, revisioned surfaces, persistent WebSocket stream, SDL3
output initialization, and explicit session-to-display routing are implemented.
The first renderer-neutral frame plan is now also implemented: a frame request
captures the selected surface revisions before the SDL adapter presents them.
The plan now carries each surface's accumulated dirty rectangle. Native text
grapheme shaping, richer grapheme/cursor composition, effects, authentication,
and VKMS gateway integration remain open. The SDL adapter now validates UTF-8,
stores one single-cell-width code point per cell, renders schema-defined cell
colors and basic attributes, carries explicit bounded cursor state, and uses
dirty rows. PTY output now feeds that same surface model for printable text,
core controls, basic ANSI cursor/erase commands, and bounded upward scrolling.
Session responses expose the current surface revision so clients can perform
optimistic updates and retry cleanly after PTY races.
Session, cell, and frame mutations have bounded idempotency-key replay with
payload conflict detection, preventing duplicate PTY creation on retries.
Broadcast stream events carry monotonic sequences with a bounded replay cursor
and explicit `replay_gap` recovery behavior. Surface snapshots provide the
authoritative HTTP resynchronization path, including text, styles, and cursor.
Optional bearer authentication now protects HTTP and WebSocket upgrades when
`BLIT_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured; TLS and token rotation remain deployment
work.
The hibr desktop has also passed a TCC-built PTY compatibility probe, and the
production `console-blit` module is operational over the OpenAPI/WebSocket
contract. Explicit focus and the first versioned input routes are now exposed
by the API. The SDL adapter uses single-surface incremental frames and
conservatively redraws multi-surface outputs with deterministic vertical
stacking. The remaining acceptance risk is terminal fidelity under the full
Hibr desktop and the complete topology/input matrix.

Kitty graphics is the first graphics-protocol deliverable. Sixel is a later
compatibility milestone against the same canonical graphics-object model;
neither protocol is advertised until its parser, resource limits, placement,
and SDL3/direct-KMS pixel gates pass.

## Milestone 1: contract vertical slice

Resolve ADR 0002 before writing server behavior. It must select the canonical
machine-readable schema format, wire framing, compatibility policy, and the
code-generation/validation boundary.

The first contract should cover only:

- server identity and capabilities;
- output enumeration and topology;
- one text surface with dimensions and cell updates;
- a frame request and presentation acknowledgement;
- stable errors and revisions.

Effects, persistence, and deployment hardening remain later concerns; the
first bounded SDL effect is now exposed by the schema and runtime, while
direct KMS remains an explicit text-only capability.

Exit criteria:

1. The schema is the only normative definition of these messages.
2. A generated or mechanically derived validation artifact is checked against
   the schema.
3. One TCC-built server accepts a request and returns a typed response.
4. The same request sequence works with the dummy backend and the VKMS backend.

## Milestone 2: authoritative state engine

Implement one state model behind all transports and renderers. Add revisions,
idempotency handling, deterministic ordering, damage tracking, and structured
diagnostics. The renderer receives immutable frame plans; it does not own API
state. The current SDL adapter has the first routing seam: a session without
an explicit output targets display one, and an explicit `display_id` targets
only that output.

## Milestone 3: multi-output presentation

Map one logical canvas to the two-output VKMS fixture, then add output loss,
mode changes, gaps, offsets, and atomicity behavior. The topology and frame
acknowledgement semantics must be tested through the public API, not through
SDL-specific test calls.

## Milestone 4: text fidelity

Add grapheme policy, cell attributes, cursor state, scrolling, and incremental
updates. Preserve text and damage as canonical state until the renderer boundary.

## Milestone 5: effects

The first bounded, deterministic SDL preset is implemented through
`/v1/effects`. Continue with the versioned effect graph, explicit frame/time
inputs, overlays, and additional presets only after preserving the same
revision and capability/error rules. CRT effects are downstream of correct
text and output semantics; they must not obscure presentation failures.

## Milestone 5a: terminal graphics protocols

Implement the canonical bounded graphics-object store and Kitty graphics
protocol first. It must support chunked upload, explicit image identifiers,
placement, clipping, z-order, deletion, diagnostics, and damage integration
without mutating terminal cells. Verify equivalent SDL3 and direct-KMS
results with deterministic pixel fixtures in the two-display VKMS guest.

After Kitty is accepted, add sixel decoding as a compatibility input path into
the same graphics-object model. Sixel must not introduce a second renderer,
layout owner, or image lifetime model.

## Milestone 6: operational hardening

Add authentication, leases, persistence policy, hotplug behavior, observability,
resource limits, and a non-root deployment profile. Repeat the full contract
suite on VKMS and then on a physical DRM/KMS host.

## Immediate next action

Run terminal conformance against the canonical PTY surface engine before adding
effects or packaging. The suite must cover Hibr's clear/redraw workload,
alternate screen, cursor movement, colors, resize, scrolling, and malformed
or fragmented escape sequences. Then repeat the 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, and 2x2 VKMS
matrix with one primary and the required `--join` clients, including explicit
keyboard and pointer routes.

The graphics-protocol work follows the accepted terminal/input and presentation
gates; do not advertise Kitty or sixel before their pixel and resource-limit
evidence exists.
